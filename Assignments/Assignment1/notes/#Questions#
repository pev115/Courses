Questions:

In the MORE TESTS Area:

is this part of the assessment or just
for us and we should grey it out at the 
end?
can i do it with the assert function?

Should we only touch the parts that we have
to do or will we be assessed say in the 
presentation of the whole thing

in the make_move function should we
cater for all possible wrong inputs
or only for positioning errors?

are we penalised if we have a code that works but is not constructed
in the most efficient way? should we try to make the code run 
as fast as possible? ex in the make_postion function i can make it 
run faster by invoquing the last function only when needed.

header file question : why do we not have the
#ifndef ect? What are these for? 


what is the helper fucntion in Q4?
