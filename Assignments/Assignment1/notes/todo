for the is_it_in_bounds -> extend functionality to take all sorts of
inputs

for the make_move-> extend so it can handle wrong digits aswell.

for make move : watch out if the position is 1 0r 0 digits it breaks down


For the tests in all questions : check that the comments are
consistent and that they give the right results -> I changed things
and  there might be inconcistensies.
