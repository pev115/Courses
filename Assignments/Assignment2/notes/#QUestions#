when having a helper function for a member function should it also be
a member function of the class it belongs to (look at the enigma
encrypt function)



Is is bad that i missspelled pluckboard?

Why cant I call a helper method within a constructor?

The way I created the rotors : How wold I use the delete opertator not
to have a memory leak?

Do I need a destructor with my enigma class?

where do the classes go in terms of stack? How come that member
functions have access to all member variables,how does that look in
terms of stack?
what about when creating an object within a class? should I destry
them?
I create the rotors dynamically and the static encryptors normally:
how is that going to look in terms of memory?

should I close the streams? Why?


for the headers of each file what methodology to follow to know what
to leave in there


Should my rotor config files be a member variable ? why? how to choose
when making a variable local or member variable? same w output message array.

could i have void pointers instead of rotor pointers and then put
rotors and staticEncryptors in the same array?


should I be using the sentinel character to keep track of the end of
my array ?? Enigma.cpp and Rotor .cpp (notch array)

What should I do with my debugging helper functions?


for errors what if someone puts a rotor config file instead of the
reflecotr? -> if yes we need to invent another type of error.
